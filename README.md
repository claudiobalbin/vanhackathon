# vanhackathon
The main goal of this project is to show a full stack structure collecting data from the database (PostgreSQL), passing through a REST API (C# MVC) and presenting it to the user in the front end (ReactJS).

The theme chosen is a possible pricing strategy to use in the SenseiOS commercialization.

All the stack runs using docker containers with a docker-compose.yml file.


Requirements:
- docker;
- docker-compose;
- internet connection;


1. Clone the repository:
https://github.com/claudiobalbin/vanhackathon


2. Run the stack:
docker-compose up


3. Enjoy!
